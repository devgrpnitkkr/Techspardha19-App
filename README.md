It started in 1995 as "Technospect" (later changed to Literati). 
The year 2013 marked the Golden Jubilee of NIT Kurukshetra, thus it was renamed as Techspardha. Etymologically, the word ‘Techspardha’ is composed of two words, ‘Tech’ in English is a contraction of technology and ‘Spardha’ in Hindi means competition.
Techspardha is known for hosting a variety of events that include competitions, exhibitions, guest lectures as well as workshops.
